            <p>We are in our initial phase where our goal is to collect the required amount of funds through donations and crowdfunding for future work. You will receive a stipend of ‚Çπ6,000 per month, but it will be held until we achieve our funding goal, which we expect to reach by March 2025. Once the goal is met, you will receive your total earnings along with an exciting bonus of upto ‚Çπ22,000, bringing your expected payout to around ‚Çπ40,000 to ‚Çπ50,000. But If you face an emergency, you can withdraw up to 50% of your earnings beforehand, though this will slightly reduce your bonus. We are expecting to achieve our goal by the end of March 2025. Then in the next phase, you‚Äôll have the opportunity to join us full-time. Salary will be offered based on performance in this phase.</p>

                <blockquote>
                    ‚ÄúHi there! I am Hammad, the Chief at Miftah. You need to know these things before you apply. We are looking for people who genuinely want to improve the quality of education in our country and want to make it more accessible and affordable. Please do not apply if your primary purpose is to earn good compensation. You have better opportunities outside. The most necessary thing we look into is your passion to work, then your skills, then your experience, then your qualifications. We are taught not to burden a soul beyond its capacity, so the workload will usually be just decent. You have to be responsive and dedicated to work. You have to work for at least 4 hours a day, those hours will be as per your schedule, you have to complete the assigned tasks and present your ideas for the problems. Although you must work remotely, we encourage you to attend our offline meetings in Delhi-NCR. Or you can be lucky if we schedule a meeting at your home, irrespective of where your home is located in India. Going back to Miftah, Miftah not only aims to provide holistic education but also accurate religious education for muslims, specialized for students that belong to that community through its unique customizable education approach. So, candidates who share our commitment to enhancing the educational landscape for the Muslim community also and who understand its unique cultural and social dynamics are highly encouraged to apply.‚Äù
